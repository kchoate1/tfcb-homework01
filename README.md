### Dataset about wasps?

I think this is a dataset about wasps.

Here's a picture of a wasp:

There are also pictures of other types of bugs such as-

1. Camponotus
2. Acathomyrmex
3. Cataglyphis

## whoever produced this set of data and images had terrible organization skills, so I fixed it for them!

# In general, tables should have one variable per column, like so:


| Variable 1        | Variable 2 | Variable 3 |
| :---------------- | :--------: | ---------: |
| data              |  data      | data       |
| data              |  data      | data       |
| data              |  data      | data       |
| data              |  data      | data       |
